# first-commit
This repo was basically created to store and showcase my portfolio projects so depending on who you are and what your intention for looking around is they
mainly serve one purpose, which is to present the range and diversity of my front-end dev skills for job application purposes. Obviously if you're willing to expand on or contribute to developing those projects strictly for non-commercial uses please feel free to do so.
